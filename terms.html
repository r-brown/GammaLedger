            <p>GammaLedger is an analytics and record-keeping tool. We do not provide personalized investment advice, portfolio management, brokerage services, or recommendations. Any output generated by the Services—such as performance analytics, scenario modeling, or risk metrics—depends on the assumptions and data you supply.</p>

                <p>Trading options and other derivatives carries substantial risk and may result in the loss of the entire investment. Past performance is not indicative of future results. You remain solely responsible for trading decisions.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="data">
            <h2>6. Data Handling & Third-Party Integrations</h2>
            <p>GammaLedger runs primarily in your browser. Trade data, API keys, and generated reports are stored locally unless you intentionally export or sync them with another service. When you choose to integrate a third-party API (for example, to retrieve quotes), you are responsible for complying with the provider's terms and for securing any credentials used.</p>
            <p>We may publish aggregated, anonymized usage metrics derived from public repository analytics, server logs for the gammaledger.com website, or voluntary feedback. These metrics will not include personal trading records.</p>

            <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>

We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or content of third-party services.</p>

            <h2>9. Termination</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice.</p>
            <p>You may discontinue use of the Service at any time. Since data is stored locally, you may delete your data at any time.</p>
            <p>Upon termination, all provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive shall survive, including but not limited to disclaimers, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution.</p>

            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the primary GammaLedger maintainer resides, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising under these Terms must first be addressed informally by contacting us. If the dispute cannot be resolved within 30 days, it may be submitted to the competent courts in that jurisdiction, unless an open-source license provides you with alternative forums.</p>

        <section id="changes">
            <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. The "Last updated" date indicates when the latest changes were posted. Material changes will be announced via the GammaLedger website or repository. Continued use of the Services after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <section id="severability">
            <h2>13. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
