            <p>Last updated: October 31, 2025</p>
            <p>This Disclaimer applies to all GammaLedger materials, including the public website, documentation, repositories, and the GammaLedger analytics application. By using any GammaLedger resource you accept the statements below.</p>
        </div>

        <section id="no-advice">
            <h2>1. No Investment Advice</h2>
            <p>GammaLedger provides portfolio analytics and record-keeping tools. We do not offer personalized financial, investment, legal, tax, or accounting advice.

            <h2>2. Investment Risk Warning</h2>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>OPTIONS TRADING IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF LOSS</p>
            </div>
            <p>Trading in options and other derivatives carries a HIGH DEGREE OF RISK and is not suitable for all investors. You should carefully consider whether options trading is appropriate for your financial situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance.</p>
            <p>3.2. Specific Risks Include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>LOSS OF ENTIRE INVESTMENT: You may lose your entire investment in a relatively short period of time</li>
                <li>LEVERAGE RISK: Options are leveraged instruments; small market movements can result in substantial losses</li>
                <li>TIME DECAY: Options lose value as they approach expiration</li>
                <li>VOLATILITY RISK: Changes in market volatility can significantly impact option values</li>
                <li>COMPLEXITY: Options strategies can be complex and difficult to understand</li>
                <li>LIQUIDITY RISK: Some options may have limited liquidity, making it difficult to exit positions</li>
                <li>MARGIN CALLS: Certain strategies may require margin and subject you to margin calls</li>
                <li>UNLIMITED LOSS POTENTIAL: Some options strategies (e.g., selling naked calls) have theoretically unlimited loss potential</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may lose MORE than your initial investment. In some cases, losses can exceed the amount of capital invested, particularly with margin accounts or certain options strategies.</p>
