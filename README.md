## ❓ FAQ

### Is my data safe?
Yes! GammaLedger uses local-first architecture. All data is stored in your browser's IndexedDB. **Nothing is sent to external servers.** Your trading data never leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy.

### How do I backup my data?
JSON database is already stored locally on your device. No explicit backup needed. For extra safety, consider backing up JSON file by creating a copy in cloud storage or an external drive.

### Does this support futures or stocks?
Currently optimized for options trading. Stock position tracking and futures support may be added in future releases based on community demand.

### Can I sync across devices?
Not automatically. For privacy and security, data is stored locally. You can manually export/import JSON backups to sync data across devices.

### Is there a paid version?
GammaLedger is open source and free forever under the AGPLv3 license for non-commercial and open-source compliant use. For proprietary, commercial, or institutional applications without AGPL restrictions, a commercial license is available.

### What brokers work with GammaLedger?
Any broker that exports OFX files trade logs. We have direct integration with Interactive Brokers. Other popular brokers (TD Ameritrade, Schwab, E*TRADE, Fidelity) support OFX export.

### What is the AI Coach feature?
The AI Coach is an integrated assistant that analyzes your trades and provides portfolio insights, risk management, position sizing, and strategy recommendations. It helps you learn and improve your trading decisions.

### How does automatic roll detection work?
When you roll an options position (close one and open another at a different strike/expiration), GammaLedger automatically detects the relationship and groups them together. This gives you accurate tracking of cumulative P&L, total credits/debits, and true break-even prices across the entire rolled position lifecycle.

### Can I track options on cryptocurrencies?
Not currently. GammaLedger focuses on equity options from traditional brokers. Crypto options support may be considered for future releases.
