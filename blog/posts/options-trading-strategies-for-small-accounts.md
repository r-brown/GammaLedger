# Options Trading Strategies For Small Accounts

Options trading can be a powerful tool for investors, but it's important to understand the strategies and their associated risks, especially for smaller accounts. Let's break down some strategies:

## 1. Wheeling (The Wheel Strategy)

The [Wheel Strategy](post.html#/complete-wheel-strategy-guide) involves selling cash-secured puts and covered calls to generate income. Here's how it works:

- **Selling Cash-Secured Puts:**  
You sell a put option, which means you agree to buy the underlying stock at a specified price (the strike price) if the option is exercised. You receive a premium for selling the put. If the stock price stays above the strike price, the put expires worthless, and you keep the premium. If the stock price falls below the strike price, you may be obligated to buy the stock.

- **Selling Covered Calls:**  
If you end up owning the stock (because the put was exercised), you then sell a call option against the stock you own. This means you agree to sell the stock at a specified price if the option is exercised. You receive a premium for selling the call. If the stock price stays below the strike price, the call expires worthless, and you keep the premium. If the stock price rises above the strike price, the stock may be called away from you.

**Risks:**  
The main risk is that the stock price could fall significantly, and you would be obligated to buy the stock at a higher price than its current market value.

## 2. Credit Spreads

Credit spreads involve selling one option and buying another option in the same expiration cycle but with different strike prices. There are two main types:

- **Bull Put Spread:**  
You sell a put option at a higher strike price and buy a put option at a lower strike price. This strategy is used when you expect the underlying asset to rise or stay the same. The premium received from selling the higher strike put is greater than the premium paid for buying the lower strike put, resulting in a net credit.

- **Bear Call Spread:**  
You sell a call option at a lower strike price and buy a call option at a higher strike price. This strategy is used when you expect the underlying asset to fall or stay the same. The premium received from selling the lower strike call is greater than the premium paid for buying the higher strike call, resulting in a net credit.

**Risks:**  
The main risk is that the underlying asset moves against your expectation, which could result in a loss. However, the loss is limited to the difference between the strike prices minus the net credit received.

## 3. LEAPS (Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities)

LEAPS are options with expiration dates that are longer than one year. They are essentially long-term options that allow investors to control a stock for an extended period without having to put up the full amount of capital required to buy the stock outright. For an advanced LEAPS strategy, see the [Poor Man's Covered Call Guide](post.html#/poor-mans-covered-call-guide).

- **Buying LEAPS Calls:**  
You buy a call option with a long expiration date, betting that the underlying stock will rise significantly over the extended period. This allows you to participate in the stock's upside potential with limited downside risk (limited to the premium paid).

- **Buying LEAPS Puts:**  
You buy a put option with a long expiration date, betting that the underlying stock will fall significantly over the extended period. This allows you to profit from a decline in the stock price with limited downside risk (limited to the premium paid).

**Risks:**  
The main risk is that the stock price does not move in the expected direction, and the option expires worthless. However, because LEAPS have a longer expiration, there is more time for the stock to move in your favor.

## Safer Options for a Smaller Account

For a smaller account, these strategies can be considered safer because they limit downside risk and can generate income:

- **Wheeling:**  
Provides a steady stream of income from selling puts and calls, with the risk limited to the capital required to buy the stock if the put is exercised.

- **Credit Spreads:**  
Offer limited risk and can generate income from the net credit received, with the maximum loss defined by the difference in strike prices.

- **LEAPS:**  
Allow for long-term exposure to a stock with limited downside risk, making them suitable for investors who want to participate in the stock's potential upside without committing a large amount of capital.

## Things to Consider

- Ensure that each trade size is suitable for your account size to prevent overexposure.

## Risk Management

- **Loss Potential:** Always be aware of the maximum potential loss and steer clear of strategies that could result in unlimited losses.

## Trade Selection

- **Liquidity:** Opt for underlyings with good liquidity to benefit from tighter spreads and better prices for entering and exiting trades (e.g., SPY).

## Education and Experience

- **Paper Trading:** Begin with paper trading to build experience without risking real money, and continuously learn and improve your skills.
